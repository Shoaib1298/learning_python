what is the difference between list,vectors and array??

-never hardcode numbers.


change the style:
-

for loop :
-for i in range(a,b):
-for x in y:
        y = list/Dis/array/...
        x assumes the individual element of the y
            if y is Distnary then x assumes key[i]
            if y is obj of csv.DistReader() then y assume the dis contain in my example {"name":bla, "school":blabla}
            always this type of using for loop is used uniquely as in case of Distonary example
        
    -[x**2 for x in list]
    -'_' if the x is not is not necessary inside the loop
list have len and np.array have .shape {note the lack of ()}
