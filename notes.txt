Cotes:

1)"shoaib Ahmed" is interprited as a single word shoaib Ahmed in command line

2)"""
this is also an comment
anything in between these trible cotes 

"""
3)"" and '' can be used interchangable and certain times alternating use is necessary


using sys lib:
        -for arg in sys.argv(inline arguments)
        -sys.exit()



Difference between list,vectors and array:
-list =[]
        list is dynamic and has many methods  
        list.append()
        list.pop()
        list.remove()
        len(list)-find the len of the list
        list[a:b]-making a slice

-vector is an np array:
        array.shape

        

-never hardcode numbers.


change the style:

-elif - else if 

for loop :
-for i in range(a,b):
-for x in y:
        y = list/Dis/array/...
        x assumes the individual element of the y
            if y is Distnary then x assumes key[i]
            if y is obj of csv.DistReader() then y assume the dis contain in my example {"name":bla, "school":blabla}
            always this type of using for loop is used uniquely as in case of Distonary example
        
    -[x**2 for x in list]
    -'_' if the x is not is not necessary inside the loop
list have len and np.array have .shape {note the lack of ()}
