-black - package to format code.
-python runs top to bottom left to right
-Adapt writing sudo code as comments
-never hardcode numbers.

Cotes:

1)"shoaib Ahmed" is interprited as a single word shoaib Ahmed in command line

2)"""
this is also an comment
anything in between these trible cotes 

"""
3)"" and '' can be used interchangable and certain times alternating use is necessary

lib:

using sys lib:
        -for arg in sys.argv(commandline arguments)
        -sys.exit()
using random:
        -random.choice(["up", "down"])
        -random.randint(1, 10)
        -shuffle(fruits)-fruits is a list 
        
Difference between list,vectors and array:
-list =[]
        list is dynamic and has many methods  
        list.append()
        list.pop()
        list.remove()
        len(list)-find the len of the list
        list[a:b]-making a slice
        pop-removes i th element from the list 
        remove-removes the first apperance of the arg in list
-vector is an np array:
        array.shape


for loop :
-for i in range(a,b):
-for x in y:
        y = list/Dis/array/...
        x assumes the individual element of the y
            if y is Distnary then x assumes key[i]
            if y is obj of csv.DistReader() then y assume the dis contain in my example {"name":bla, "school":blabla}
            always this type of using for loop is used uniquely as in case of Distonary example
        
    -[x**2 for x in list]
    -'_' if the x is not is not necessary inside the loop

if():
        xyz
elif():
        xyz
